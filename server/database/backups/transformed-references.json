Premiering in 1923, three years after her canonization by the Roman Catholic Church, the play reflects Shaw's belief that the people involved in Joan's trial acted according to what they thought was right. He wrote in his preface to the play:\n\n❝ There are no villains in the piece. Crime, like disease, is not interesting: it is something to be done away with by general consent, and that is all [there is] about it. It is what men do at their best, with good intentions, and what normal men and women find that they must and will do in spite of their intentions, that really concern us. ❞\n\nShaw characterised Saint Joan as \"A Chronicle Play in 6 Scenes and an Epilogue \". Joan, a simple peasant girl, claims to experience visions of Saint Margaret, Saint Catherine, and the archangel Michael, which she says were sent by God to guide her conduct.",

      "description": "\"Les Contemplations\" is a major poetry collection by Victor Hugo, published in 1856. Here are some key facts about this seminal work:\n\n- It consists of 158 poems divided into six books, most written between 1841 and 1855, though some date back to 1830.\n\n- The collection is deeply autobiographical, with memory playing a central role. It serves as a poetic autobiography, with Hugo experimenting with the memoir genre in verse.[1][2] \n\n- Many poems pay tribute to Hugo's daughter Léopoldine, who drowned accidentally in the Seine in 1843. Her tragic death profoundly marked the work and its structure.[1][3]\n\n- While continuing the lyricism of earlier works like Les Rayons et les Ombres, Les Contemplations also marked a shift towards a darker, more introspective poetry, representing a second poetic rebirth for Hugo.\n\n- The collection explores themes of love, joy, death, mourning, and a mystical faith. Hugo affirms his belief in the immortality of the soul and a form of metempsychosis.\n\n- Beyond the personal, Les Contemplations also serve as a mirror reflecting the collective soul, with a critical eye on 19th century society, its inequalities and misery.\n\n- It is considered one of the major works of French Romantic poetry, illustrating Hugo's lyrical genius at its apex.",

When we play video games, our facial expressions are rarely those of happiness or bliss. Instead, we frown, grimace, and shout in frustration as we lose, or die, or fail to advance to the next level. Humans may have a fundamental desire to succeed and feel competent, but game players choose to engage in an activity in which they are nearly certain to fail and feel incompetent. So why do we play video games even though they make us unhappy? Juul examines this paradox.",

      "description": "Aristotle's Poetics is the earliest surviving work of Greek dramatic theory and the first extant philosophical treatise to focus on literary theory.\n\nIn this text Aristotle offers an account of ποιητική, which refers to poetry and more literally \"the poetic art,\" deriving from the term for \"poet; author; maker,\" ποιητής. Aristotle divides the art of poetry into verse drama (comedy, tragedy, and the satyr play), lyric poetry, and epic.\n\nThe genres all share the function of mimesis, or imitation of life, but differ in three ways that Aristotle describes:\n\n• Differences in music rhythm, harmony, meter, and melody.\n• Difference of goodness in the characters.\n• Difference in how the narrative is presented: telling a story or acting it out.\n\nThe surviving book of Poetics is primarily concerned with drama; the analysis of tragedy constitutes the core of the discussion.",

In the contrast between Bluntschli, the mercenary soldier, and the brave leader, Sergius, the true nature of valour is revealed. Shaw mocks deluded idealism in Candida, when a young poet becomes infatuated with the wife of a Socialist preacher. The Man of Destiny is a witty war of words between Napoleon and a 'strange lady', while in the exuberant farce You Never Can Tell a divided family is reunited by chance. Although Shaw intended Plays Pleasant to be gentler comedies than those in their companion volume, Plays Unpleasant, their prophetic satire is sharp and provocative.",
