"LFdYQ6735kBoojPK60mo","Les Contemplations","en","","""Les Contemplations"" is a major poetry collection by Victor Hugo, published in 1856. Here are some key facts about this seminal work:

- It consists of 158 poems divided into six books, most written between 1841 and 1855, though some date back to 1830.

- The collection is deeply autobiographical, with memory playing a central role. It serves as a poetic autobiography, with Hugo experimenting with the memoir genre in verse.[1][2] 

- Many poems pay tribute to Hugo's daughter Léopoldine, who drowned accidentally in the Seine in 1843. Her tragic death profoundly marked the work and its structure.[1][3]

- While continuing the lyricism of earlier works like Les Rayons et les Ombres, Les Contemplations also marked a shift towards a darker, more introspective poetry, representing a second poetic rebirth for Hugo.

- The collection explores themes of love, joy, death, mourning, and a mystical faith. Hugo affirms his belief in the immortality of the soul and a form of metempsychosis.

- Beyond the personal, Les Contemplations also serve as a mirror reflecting the collective soul, with a critical eye on 19th century society, its inequalities and misery.

- It is considered one of the major works of French Romantic poetry, illustrating Hugo's lyrical genius at its apex.","book","Poetry","https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/memorare-98eee.appspot.com/o/images%2Fpp%2FLes-Contemplations-1716733966974.jpg?alt=media","[{""type"":""wikipedia"",""url"":""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Contemplations""}]","","","","","","","",""

In this text Aristotle offers an account of ποιητική, which refers to poetry and more literally ""the poetic art,"" deriving from the term for ""poet; author; maker,"" ποιητής. Aristotle divides the art of poetry into verse drama (comedy, tragedy, and the satyr play), lyric poetry, and epic.

The genres all share the function of mimesis, or imitation of life, but differ in three ways that Aristotle describes:

• Differences in music rhythm, harmony, meter, and melody.
• Difference of goodness in the characters.
• Difference in how the narrative is presented: telling a story or acting it out.

The surviving book of Poetics is primarily concerned with drama; the analysis of tragedy constitutes the core of the discussion.","book","Dramatic theory","https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/memorare-98eee.appspot.com/o/images%2Fpp%2FPoetics (Aristotle)-1695136412474.jpg?alt=media","[{""type"":""wikipedia"",""url"":""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetics_(Aristotle)""}]","","","","","","","",""

In the contrast between Bluntschli, the mercenary soldier, and the brave leader, Sergius, the true nature of valour is revealed. Shaw mocks deluded idealism in Candida, when a young poet becomes infatuated with the wife of a Socialist preacher. The Man of Destiny is a witty war of words between Napoleon and a 'strange lady', while in the exuberant farce You Never Can Tell a divided family is reunited by chance. Although Shaw intended Plays Pleasant to be gentler comedies than those in their companion volume, Plays Unpleasant, their prophetic satire is sharp and provocative.","book","Essay","https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/memorare-98eee.appspot.com/o/images%2Fpp%2FPréface aux pièces plaisantes-1704118718971.jpg?alt=media","[]","","","","","","","",""

"n2fptztAGYb2ZEjg7aaA","Summer Game Fest","en","","Summer Game Fest is an annual live video game event organized and hosted by game journalist Geoff Keighley.

- It takes place over multiple live streams during the summer period in North America.

- The main highlight is the ""main show"" which showcases upcoming major game releases through trailers and announcements. This is usually held on the first day.

- After the main show, there is a ""Day of the Devs"" stream focused on highlighting upcoming indie games.

- Other publisher-specific streams and events also occur in the days following the main show.

- It was created in 2020 following the cancellation of major gaming events like E3 due to COVID-19.

Business Model

- Publishers pay fees to have trailers aired during the main show, with rates estimated around $250,000 for a 1-minute trailer in 2024.

- A few ""free slots"" are reserved for smaller indie studios during the main show.
