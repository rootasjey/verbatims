It serves as a poetic autobiography, with Hugo experimenting with the memoir genre in verse.[1][2] \n\n- Many poems pay tribute to Hugo's daughter Léopoldine, who drowned accidentally in the Seine in 1843. Her tragic death profoundly marked the work and its structure.[1][3]\n\n- While continuing the lyricism of earlier works like Les Rayons et les Ombres, Les Contemplations also marked a shift towards a darker, more introspective poetry, representing a second poetic rebirth for Hugo.\n\n- The collection explores themes of love, joy, death, mourning, and a mystical faith. Hugo affirms his belief in the immortality of the soul and a form of metempsychosis.\n\n- Beyond the personal, Les Contemplations also serve as a mirror reflecting the collective soul, with a critical eye on 19th century society, its inequalities and misery.\n\n- It is considered one of the major works of French Romantic poetry, illustrating Hugo's lyrical genius at its apex.","type":{"primary":"book","secondary":"Poetry"},"updated_at":{"__time__":"2024-05-26T14:32:37.134Z"},"urls":{"amazon":"","facebook":"","image":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/memorare-98eee.appspot.com/o/images%2Fpp%2FLes-Contemplations-1716733966974.jpg?alt=media","imageName":"Les-Contemplations-1716733966974.jpg","imdb":"","instagram":"","netflix":"","prime_video":"","twitch":"","twitter":"","website":"","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Contemplations","youtube":""},"__collections__":{}},"LXiJcnWZDEGh6Q8uD3wU":{"created_at":{"__time__":"2020-09-15T09:58:59.541Z"},"image":{"credits":{"artist":"","before_common_era":false,"company":"","date":null,"location":"","name":"","url":""}},"language":"en","name":"Watchmen","release":{"before_common_era":false,"original":null},"summary":"Watchmen is an American superhero drama limited television series based on the 1986 DC Comics series Watchmen, created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons.","summary_localized":{},"type":{"primary":"TV series","secondary":"Superhero drama"},"type_localized":{},"updated_at":{"__time__":"2020-09-15T09:58:59.541Z"},"urls":{"amazon":"","facebook":"","image":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/memorare-98eee.appspot.com/o/images%2Fpp%2Fwatchmen_tv_series.jpg?alt=media&token=301432ef-0ef1-4eda-bb3d-2c0c24597019","image_name":"","imdb":"","instagram":"","netflix":"","prime_video":"","tiktok":"","twitch":"","twitter":"","website":"https://www.hbo.com/watchmen","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(TV_series)","youtube":""},"__collections__":{}},"LXpNf3DiptFBXGYadidl":{"created_at":{"__time__":"2020-07-01T22:17:33.716Z"},"id":"LXpNf3DiptFBXGYadidl","image":{"credits":{"artist":"","before_common_era":false,"company":"","date":{"__time__":"2023-12-18T15:37:30.212Z"},"location":"","name":"","url":""}},"language":"en","name":"Amanda Knox","release":{"before_common_era":false,"original":{"__time__":"2023-12-18T15:37:30.212Z"}},"summary":"The story of the trial, conviction and acquittal of Amanda Knox for the murder of an exchange student in Italy.","summary_localized":{},"type":{"primary":"film","secondary":"Documentary"},"type_localized":{},"updated_at":{"__time__":"2020-07-01T22:17:33.716Z"},"urls":{"amazon":"","facebook":"","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Amanda_Knox_%28film%29.png","imdb":"","instagram":"","netflix":"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80081155","prime_video":"","twitch":"","twitter":"","website":"","wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Knox_(film)","youtube":""},"__collections__":{}},"LoePEmZLbtKV7qwWokRI":{"created_at":{"__time__":"2020-02-01T22:11:00.340Z"},"image":{"credits":{"artist":"","before_common_era":false,"company":"","date":null,"location":"","name":"","url":""}},"language":"fr","links":[],"name":"Histoire(s) de femmes","release":{"before_common_era":false,"original":null},"summary":"","summary_localized":{},"type":{"primary":"","secondary":""},"type_localized":{},"updated_at":{"__time__":"2020-02-01T22:11:00.340Z"},"urls":{"affiliate":"","amazon":"","facebook":"","image":"","image_name":"","imdb":"","instagram":"","netflix":"","prime_video":"","tiktok":"","twitch":"","twitter":"","website":"https://www.amazon.fr/150-lutte-pour-droits-femmes/dp/2035966299","wikipedia":"https://www.amazon.fr/150-lutte-pour-droits-femmes/dp/2035966299","youtube":""},"__collections__":{}},"M5HNY6m2ZaJ5PSHGtLyy":{"created_at":{"__time__":"2020-03-30T01:15:56.583Z"},"image":{"credits":{"artist":"","before_common_era":false,"company":"","date":null,"location":"","name":"","url":""}},"language":"fr","name":"La Cité de la peur","release":{"before_common_era":false,"original":null},"summary":"La Cité de la peur (French: \"The City of Fear\"), also known as Le film de Les Nuls (\"The Les Nuls Movie\"), is a 1994 French comedy film written by and starring Chantal Lauby, Alain Chabat and Dominique Farrugia.

When we play video games, our facial expressions are rarely those of happiness or bliss. Instead, we frown, grimace, and shout in frustration as we lose, or die, or fail to advance to the next level. Humans may have a fundamental desire to succeed and feel competent, but game players choose to engage in an activity in which they are nearly certain to fail and feel incompetent. So why do we play video games even though they make us unhappy?

The Man of Destiny is a witty war of words between Napoleon and a 'strange lady', while in the exuberant farce You Never Can Tell a divided family is reunited by chance.
