- She was a French writer, philosopher, and feminist theorist who is best known for her seminal work "The Second Sex" published in 1949. This groundbreaking book analyzed the oppression of women in society and laid the foundation for modern feminism.

- Beauvoir was born in Paris in 1908 into a bourgeois family. She was raised Catholic but became an atheist at age 14.

- She studied at the University of Paris (Sorbonne) and passed the highly competitive agrégation exam in philosophy at the youngest possible age of 21, coming second only to her lifelong companion Jean-Paul Sartre.

- Beauvoir and Sartre had an unconventional open relationship for over 50 years, never marrying but remaining intellectual and romantic partners until Sartre''s death in 1980.

- In addition to "The Second Sex", she wrote novels, memoirs, biographies and political treatises, often exploring existentialist themes. Her novel "The Mandarins" won France''s prestigious Prix Goncourt in 1954.

- She was deeply involved in political activism, speaking out against the French colonial policies in Algeria and supporting feminist causes like the legalization of abortion in France.

- Beauvoir died in Paris in 1986 at age 78 and is buried next to Sartre in the Montparnasse Cemetery.

His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.

- Charles Chaplin (1889-1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film with his iconic "Tramp" character.

- He was a pioneering filmmaker who acted in, directed, produced, edited, and composed the music for most of his films. Some of his most famous works include The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), and The Great Dictator (1940).

- Chaplin had a very difficult childhood marked by poverty and hardship. His mother was committed to a mental asylum when he was young, and he was sent to a workhouse twice before age 9.

- He began performing on stage at a very young age, making his first amateur appearance at age 5.[1] By age 26, he had become one of the highest paid people in the world with a contract for $670,000 per year.

- Chaplin composed the scores and songs for several of his films, including the popular songs "Smile" from Modern Times and "This Is My Song" from A Countess from Hong Kong. He won an Academy Award for Best Original Score for Limelight in 1973.

- He was married four times, including three marriages to teenagers when he was much older. His turbulent personal life, political views, and marriages to young women caused scandals.

- Chaplin was a perfectionist who would do hundreds of takes to get a scene right. For City Lights, he made an actress repeat just two words ("Flower, sir") 342 times.

- He co-founded the movie studio United Artists in 1919 with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D.W. Griffith as a way to maintain creative control over their films.

- In January 2009, Nakamoto released the first Bitcoin software and mined the first block of bitcoins, known as the "genesis block."

- Nakamoto communicated with early Bitcoin developers through online forums and email until around 2010, after which they disappeared from public view.

- Their true identity remains a mystery, with various theories speculating that Nakamoto could be an individual like Nick Szabo or Hal Finney, or even a group of developers.

- Nakamoto is estimated to have mined around 1 million bitcoins, which would be worth billions of dollars today, but this stash has remained untouched.

- In 2015, Nakamoto was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Economics for their contributions to the creation of Bitcoin.

- Despite numerous claims by individuals like Craig Wright, no one has provided conclusive evidence of being the real Satoshi Nakamoto.
